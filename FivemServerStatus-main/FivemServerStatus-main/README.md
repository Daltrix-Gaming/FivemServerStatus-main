## Notices:
- Please make sure you Google your errors before joining the support server. I don't have time to help you setup the bot. Google is your friend make use of it.... stack overflow is very handy!
- If you are unable to get the bot to query your server **please** make sure you check that the IP address and port for you server are correct in the config.json file before asking for support
    - Also make sure your firewall on your host isn't blocking inbound connections
- If you get an error in console saying `(node:121108) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: fields.flat is not a function` you'll need to update your Node.js version. I have provided a link-to that explains how to update your Node.js version [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version)
- If you get an error in console saying `! Make sure you have the latest version of node.js and npm installed.` you'll need to make sure both your NPM & Node.js is on the latest version. I have provided a link-to that explains how to update your NPM version [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm) and Node.js version [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version)
